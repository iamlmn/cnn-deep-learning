## Mnist Classification using tensorflow & Tflearn

## [Mnist-Tensorflow.ipynb](https://github.com/iamlmn/deep-learning/edit/master/Mnist-cnn-tensorflow/Mnist-Tensorflow.ipynb) has got both classification of mnist data using cnn & MLP using tensorflow.
### Inferences 
> CNN worked better clearly.

## [Mnist-Tflearn](https://github.com/iamlmn/deep-learning/edit/master/Mnist-cnn-tensorflow/Mnist-Tflearn.ipynb) : Implementation of Mnist classification cnn using Tflearn.
### Inferences
> Number of lines in code got reduced to 50% .
